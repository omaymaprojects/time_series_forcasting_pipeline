# Forecasting Private Equity Investment Metrics within a CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
In this project, I developed a sophisticated forecasting model to predict key investment metrics for private equity (PE) firms using simulated time series data. The aim was to enhance strategic decision-making by providing forecasts of capital invested, the number of deals, and return on investment.

## Objective
To empower PE firms with predictive insights to optimize investment strategies and effectively manage risks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning.
- **Git**: For source control management.
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: Managed data versioning to ensure reproducibility.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Automated processes from data preprocessing to model training and report generation.

## Methodology

### Data Generation and Preprocessing
- Generated time series data reflecting typical economic and investment scenarios in the PE sector.
- Preprocessed the data to ensure it was suitable for modeling.

### Model Development
- Implemented an ARIMA model enhanced with ARIMAX for dynamic market trend capture.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Configured GitLab CI/CD for automated management and systematic performance tracking.
- Automated the entire process from data preprocessing to model training and report generation.

## Challenges Overcome
- Tackled large-scale data management with DVC.
- Developed a comprehensive GitLab CI/CD pipeline reducing manual errors and enhancing automation.
- Integrated DevOps in data science for continuous deployment and model improvement.

## Outcomes
- Successfully delivered a predictive system providing monthly forecasts on crucial PE metrics, aiding in informed decision-making.
- The GitLab CI/CD automation significantly reduced time-to-market for insights and enabled agile responses to market changes.

## Future Scope
- Expand the model to include more datasets and real-time data feeds.
- Implement adaptive machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate market sentiment analysis to refine strategies further.

## Migration to GitHub

This project is now migrated to GitHub, leveraging GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline.
